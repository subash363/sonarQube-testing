# SonarQube-AzureAppService
This project is to facilitate hosting [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) in an [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/) directly. This does not require SonarQube to be in a Linux container. You can also use the same [HttpPlatformHandlerStartup.ps1](https://github.com/vanderby/SonarQube-AzureAppService/blob/master/HttpPlatformHandlerStartup.ps1) and [HttpPlatformHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/httpplatformhandler/httpplatformhandler-configuration-reference) extension to host SonarQube in IIS on a hosted machine. This would eliminate the need for more complicated setup of IIS as a reverse proxy.

This project uses the embedded database. It is recommended for production to move to a proper database (MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, Postgre) which can also be a hosted in Azure.

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure & Project Files
Use the ***Deploy to Azure*** button above to deploy out an Azure App Service  along with the additional files from this project.

### Step 2: Upload SonarQube Files
Locally, run the  [***Upload-SonarQubeToAzure.ps1***](https://github.com/vanderby/SonarQube-AzureAppService/blob/master/Upload-SonarQubeToAzure.ps1) script from this project to upload the latest SonarQube files to the newly created app service. This utilizes the [Zip Deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-deploy-zip) API endpoint. Alternatively you can manually upload the extracted SonarQube files through your deployment methodology of choice.

## In-Depth Details
This project is made possible by the [HttpPlatformHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/httpplatformhandler/httpplatformhandler-configuration-reference). This extension will start any executable and forward requests it receives onto the port defined in HTTP\_PLATFORM\_PORT environment variable. This port is randomly chosen at each invocation. A web.config file is used to tell the HttpPlatformHandler which file to execute and what parameters to pass along to the executing file.

 In order to make this work with SonarQube the [HttpPlatformHandlerStartup.ps1](https://github.com/vanderby/SonarQube-AzureAppService/blob/master/HttpPlatformHandlerStartup.ps1) script is executed by the HttpPlatformHandler. The script searches for the sonar.properties file and writes the port defined in the HTTP\_PLATFORM\_PORT environment variable to the properties file. Then it finds a StartSonar.bat file to start SonarQube.
